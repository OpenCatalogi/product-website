# The Common Gateway and the Product Website Template

The Common Gateway is an open-source project that serves as a bridge between different systems, enabling them to communicate and share data. As the project evolved and grew, the team realized they needed a dedicated product page to showcase their work and provide up-to-date documentation to their users.

That's where the Product Website Template came in. The Common Gateway team decided to use the template to quickly set up their product page. The template's ability to create a product page based on the contents of a repository was a perfect fit for their needs.

The team started by customizing the template to match their branding. They used their organization's NL design token to style the product page, creating a consistent look and feel that reinforced their brand identity.

Next, they utilized the template's dynamic menu feature to organize their documentation. They added folders to the main menu, each representing a different section of their documentation. The template automatically created a submenu item for each markdown file in the folders, turning each file into its own page under the corresponding main menu item.

One of the key benefits of this approach was that the product page was always up-to-date with the latest documentation. Whenever the team updated a markdown file in their repository, the corresponding page on the product page was automatically updated as well. This ensured that users always had access to the most recent information about the Common Gateway.

By using the Product Website Template, the Common Gateway team was able to quickly set up a user-friendly, accessible, and up-to-date product page for their project. It's a testament to the power and versatility of the template, and a great example of how it can be used to showcase an open-source project.

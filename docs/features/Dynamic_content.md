# Dynamic Content: Keeping Your Product Page Up-to-Date with Ease

One of the standout features of the Product Website Template is its ability to dynamically pull content directly from the markdown files in your repository. This is achieved through the use of the GitHub API, which allows the template to access and display the latest content from your repository.

What does this mean for you? It means that your product page will always display the most up-to-date information without the need for continuous manual updates. Whenever you update a markdown file in your repository, the changes are automatically reflected on your product page. This ensures that your users always have access to the latest information about your product.

But the benefits of dynamic content go beyond just keeping your product page current. By pulling content directly from your repository, the Product Website Template essentially functions as a headless system, with your repository serving as its content management system. This approach separates the presentation layer (the product page) from the content layer (the repository), providing a flexible and efficient way to manage and display your content.

In essence, the dynamic content feature of the Product Website Template allows you to focus on developing your product and creating great content, while the template takes care of keeping your product page up-to-date.

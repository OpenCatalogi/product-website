# Features of the Product Website Template

The Product Website Template offers a range of features designed to help you create a professional and user-friendly product page for your open-source project. Here's a brief overview of some of the key features:

## Dynamic Content
The template can dynamically pull content directly from the markdown files in your repository using the GitHub API. This ensures that your product page always displays the most up-to-date information. [Read more about Dynamic Content](Dynamic_content.md).

## NL Design Tokens
You can customize the look and feel of your product page using your organization's NL design tokens. This allows you to maintain a consistent brand identity across your products and services. [Read more about NL Design Tokens](NL_Design.md).

## Dynamic Menu
The template features a dynamic menu that automatically creates submenu items for each markdown file in a folder. This provides a flexible and intuitive way to organize and navigate your content. [Read more about the Dynamic Menu](Dynamic_menu.md).

## Jumbotron
The jumbotron is a design element that you can use to quickly convey the essence of your project. It can display a bold title, a compelling subtitle, and a brief description of your project. [Read more about the Jumbotron](Jumbotron.md).

## Adding features
Remember, the Product Website Template is an open-source project. This means that you can expa
nd on these features by building them yourself. Alternatively, you can add new features to the project's [roadmap](../roadmap/README.md). Either way, you have the opportunity to contribute to the development of the template and help make it even better for the community.
